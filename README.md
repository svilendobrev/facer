facer
=====

tiny language for interface/protocol description, in python. Methods - signature, inheritance, specialization; argument and result types, cardinality and optionality, in. Use visitor to generate anything further. Cloning over different set of types/arguments. All kind of checks are possible - if called. Similar to static_type but with different intention - for (www) APIs.
